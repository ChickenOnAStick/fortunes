The Couple Overfloweth

We sometimes go on as though people cant express themselves. In fact theyre always expressing themselves. The sorriest couples are those where the woman cant be preoccupied or tired without the man saying Whats wrong? Say something, or the man, without the woman saying  and so on. Radio and television have spread this spirit everywhere, and were riddled with pointless talk, insane quantities of words and images. Stupiditys never blind or mute. So its not a problem of getting people to express themselves but of providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say. Repressive forces dont stop people expressing themselves but rather force them to express themselves; What a relief to have nothing to say, the right to say nothing, because only then is there a chance of framing the rare, and ever rarer, thing that might be worth saying. What were plagued by these days isnt any blocking of communication, but pointless statements. But what we call the meaning of a statement is its point. Thats the only definition of meaning, and it comes to the same thing as a statements novelty. You can listen to people for hours, but whats the point? . . . Thats why arguments are such a strain, why theres never any point arguing. You cant just tell someone what theyre saying is pointless. So you tell them its wrong. But what someone says is never wrong, the problem isnt that some things are wrong, but that theyre stupid or irrelevant. That theyve already been said a thousand times. The notions of relevance, necessity, the point of something, are a thousand times more significant than the notion of truth. Not as substitutes for truth, but as the measure of the truth of what Im saying. Its the same in mathematics: Poincar used to say that many mathematical theories are completely irrelevant, pointless; He didnt say they were wrong  that wouldnt have been so bad.

State philosophy reposes on a double identity: of the thinking subject, and of the concepts it creates and to which it lends its own presumed attributes of sameness and constancy. The subjects, its concepts, and also the objects in the world to which the concepts are applied have a shared, internal essence: the self-resemblance at the basis of identity. Representational thought is analogical; its concern is to establish a correspondence between these symmetrically structured domains. The faculty of judgment is the policeman of analogy, assuring that each of these terms is honestly itself, and that the proper correspondences obtain. In thought its end is truth, in action justice. The weapons it wields in their pursuit are limitive distribution (the determination of the exclusive set of properties possessed by each term in contradistinction to the others: logos, law) and hierarchical ranking (the measurement of the degree of perfection of a terms self-resemblance in relation to a supreme standard, man, god, or gold: value, morality). The modus operandi is negation: x = x = not y. Identity, resemblance, truth, justice, and negation. The rational foundation for order. The established order, of course: philosophers have traditionally been employees of the State. The collusion between philosophy and the State was most explicitly enacted in the first decade of the nineteenth century with the foundation of the University of Berlin, which was to become the model of higher learning throughout Europe and in the United States. The goal laid out for it by Wilhelm von Humboldt (based on proposals by Fichte and Schleiermacher) was the spiritual and moral training of the nation, to be achieved by deriving everything from an original principle (truth), by relating everything to an ideal (justice), and by unifying this principle and this ideal to a single Idea (the State). The end product would be a fully legitimated subject of knowledge and society  each mind an analogously organized mini-State morally unified in the supermind of the State. More insidious than the well-known practical cooperation between university and government (the burgeoning military funding of research) is its philosophical role in the propagation of the form of representational thinking itself, that properly spiritual absolute State endlessly reproduced and disseminated at every level of the social fabric.

The annals of official philosophy are populated by bureaucrats of pure reason who speak in the shadow of the despot and are in historical complicity with the State. They invent a properly spiritualabsolute State that effectively functions in the mind. Theirs is a discourse of sovereign judgment, of stable subjectivity legislated by good sense, of rocklike identity, universal truth, and (white male) justice. Thus the exercise of their thought is in conformity with the aims of the real State, with the dominant significations, and with the requirements of the established order.

A single and same voice for the whole thousand-voiced multiple, a single and same Ocean for all the drops, a single clamour of Being for all beings: on the condition that each being, each drop, and each voice has reached the state of excess  in other words, the difference which displaces and disguises them and, in turning upon the mobile cusp, causes them to return.

What does it mean to love somebody? It is always to seize that person in a mass, extract him or her from a group, however small, in which he or she participates, whether it be through the family only or through something else; then to find that person's own packs, the multiplicities he or she encloses within himself or herself which may be of an entirely different nature. To join them to mine, to make them penetrate mine, and for me to penetrate the other person's. Heavenly nuptials, multiplicities of multiplicities. Every love is an exercise in depersonalization on a body without organs yet to be formed, and it is at the highest point of this depersonalization that some- one can be named, receives his or her family name or first name, acquires the most intense discernibility in the instantaneous apprehension of the multiplicities belonging to him or her, and to which he or she belongs. A pack of freckles on a face, a pack of boys speaking through the voice of a woman, a clutch of girls in Charlus's voice, a horde of wolves in somebody's throat, a multiplicity of anuses in the anus, mouth, or eye one is intent upon. We each go through so many bodies in each other.

Signs imply ways of living, possibilities of existence, they are the symptoms of an overflowing (jaillissante) or exhausted (puise) life. But an artist cannot be content with an exhausted life, nor with a personal life. One does not write with one's ego, one's memory, and one's illnesses. In the act of writing there's an attempt to make life something more personal, to liberate life from what imprisons it...There is a profound link between signs, the event, life, and vitalism. It is the power of nonorganic life, that which can be found in a line of a drawing, a line of writing, a line of music. It is organisms that die, not life. There is no work of art that does not indicate an opening for life, a path between the cracks. Everything I have written has been vitalistic, at least I hope so, and constitutes a theory of signs and the event.

The death of a social machine has never been heralded by a disharmony or a dysfunction; on the contrary, social machines make a habit of feeding on the contradictions they give rise to, on the crises they provoke, on the anxieties they engender, and on the infernal operations they regenerate. Capitalism has learned this, and has ceased doubting itself, while even socialists have abandoned belief in the possibility of capitalism's natural death by attrition. No one has ever died from contradictions. And the more it breaks down, the more it schizophrenizes, the better it works, the American way.

Let us take a limited example and compare the war machine and the state apparatus in the context of the theory of games. Let us take chess and Go, from the standpoint of game pieces, the relations between the pieces and the space involved. Chess is a game of the State, or of the court: the emperor of China played it. Chess pieces are coded; they have an internal nature and intrinsic properties from which their movements, situations, and confrontations derive. They have qualities; a knight remains a knight, a pawn a pawn, a bishop a bishop. Each is like a subject of the statement endowed with relative power, and these relative powers combine in a subject of enunciation, that is, the chess player or the games form of interiority. Go pieces, I contrast, are pellets, disks, simple arithmetic units, and have only an anonymous, collective, or third-person function: It makes a move. It could be a man, a woman, a louse, an elephant. Go pieces are elements of a nonsubjectified machine assemblage with no intrinsic properties, only situational ones. Thus the relations are very different in the two cases.

Within their milieu of interiority, chess pieces entertain biunivocal relations with one another, and with the adversarys pieces: their functioning is structural. One the other hand, a Go piece has only a milieu of exteriority, or extrinsic relations with nebulas or constellations, according to which it fulfills functions of insertion or situation, such as bordering, encircling, shattering. All by itself, a Go piece can destroy an entire constellation synchronically; a chess piece cannot (or can do so diachronically only). Chess is indeed a war, but an institutionalized, regulated, coded war with a front, a rear, battles. But what is proper to Go is war without battle lines, with neither confrontation nor retreat, without battles even: pure strategy, whereas chess is a semiology. Finally, the space is not at all the same: in chess, it is a question of arranging a closed space for oneself, thus going from one point to another, of occupying the maximum number of squares with the minimum number of pieces. In Go, it is a question of arraying oneself in an open space, of holding space, of maintaining the possibility of springing up at any point: the movement is not from one point to another, but becomes perpetual, without aim or destination, without departure or arrival. The smooth space of Go, as against the striated space of chess. The nomos of Go against the State of chess, nomos against polis. The difference is that chess codes and decodes space, whereas Go proceeds altogether differently, territorializing and deterritorializing it (make the outside a territory in space; consolidate that territory by the construction of a second, adjacent territory; deterritorialize the enemy by shattering his territory from within; deterritorialize oneself by renouncing, by going elsewhere) Another justice, another movement, another space-time.

Ce nseamn a iubi pe cineva? A-l desprinde ntotdeauna dintr-o mas, a-l extrage dintr-un grup, chiar i restrns, din care face parte fie i doar prin intermediul familiei sau prin altceva; i apoi a cuta s afli care sunt propriile lui haite, mulimile pe care le conine n el nsui i care sunt, poate, de o cu totul alt natur. A le uni cu ale tale, a le face s ptrund n ale tale i a ptrunde tu nsui n ale lui. Celeste nuni, mulimi de mulimi. Nu exist iubire care s nu fie un exerciiu de depersonalizare pe un corp fr organe ce se cere creat; i doar n punctul cel mai nalt al acestei depersonalizri poate cineva s fie numit, i primete numele sau prenumele, i dobndete discernabilitatea cea mai intens prin surprinderea instantanee a multiplilor care i aparin i crora le aparine. ... sfritul iubirii l restituie indiscernabilului.

The law is not known, since there is nothing in it to know. We come across it only through its action, and it acts only through its sentence and its execution. It is not distinguishable from the application. We know it only through its imprint on our heart and our flesh: we are guilty, necessarily guilty. Guilt is like the moral thread which duplicates the thread of time.

The problem is no longer getting people to express themselves, but providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which they might eventually find something to say... What a relief to have nothing to say, the right to say nothing, because only then is there a chance of framing...the thing that might be worth saying.

Of course, Kafka doesn't see himself as a sort of party. He doesn't even pretend to be revolutionary, whatever his socialist sympathies may be. He knows that all the lines link him to a literary machine of expression for which he is simultaneously the gears, the mechanic, the operator, and the victim. So how will he proceed in this bachelor machine that doesn't make use of, and can't make use of, social critique? How will he make a revolution?

He will act on the German language such as it is in Czechoslovakia. Since it is a deterritorialized language in many ways, he will push the deterritorialization farther, not through intensities, reversals and thickenings of the language but through a sobriety that makes language take flight on a straight line, anticipates or produces its segmentations. Expression must sweep up content; the same process must happen to form... It is not a politics of pessimism, nor a literary caricature or a form of science fiction.

Philosophy is the theory of multiplicities, each of which is composed of actual and virtual elements. Purely actual objects do not exist. Every actual surrounds itself with a cloud of virtual images. This cloud is composed of a series of more or less extensive coexisting circuits, along which the virtual images are distributed, and around which they run. These virtuals vary in kind as well as in their degree of proximity from the actual particles by which they are both emitted and absorbed. They are called virtual in so far as their emission and absorption, creation and destruction, occur in a period of time shorter than the shortest continuous period imaginable; it is this very brevity that keeps them subject to a principle of uncertainty or indetermination. The virtuals, encircling the actual, perpetually renew themselves by emitting yet others, with which they are in turn surrounded and which go on in turn to react upon the actual: in the heart of the cloud of the virtual there is a virtual of a yet higher order ... every virtual particle surrounds itself with a virtual cosmos and each in its turn does likewise indefinitely. It is the dramatic identity of their dynamics that makes a perception resemble a particle: an actual perception surrounds itself with a cloud of virtual images, distributed on increasingly remote, increasingly large, moving circuits, which both make and unmake each other. These are memories of different sorts, but they are still called virtual images in that their speed or brevity subjects them too to a principle of the unconsciousness.

It is by virtue of their mutual inextricability that virtual images are able to react upon actual objects. From this perspective, the virtual images delimit a continuum, whether one takes all of the circles together or each individually, a spatium determined in each case by the maximum of time imaginable. The varyingly dense layers of the actual object correspond to these, more or less extensive, circles of virtual images. These layers, whilst themselves virtual, and upon which the actual object becomes itself virtual, constitute the total impetus of the object. The plane of immanence, upon which the dissolution of the actual object itself occurs, is itself constituted when both object and image are virtual. But the process of actualization undergone by the actual is one which has as great an effect on the image as it does on the object. The continuum of virtual images is fragmented and the spatium cut up according to whether the temporal decompositions are regular or irregular. The total impetus of the virtual object splits into forces corresponding to the partial continuum, and the speeds traversing the cut-up spatium. The virtual is never independent of the singularities which cut it up and divide it out on the plane of immanence. As Leibniz has shown, force is as much a virtual in the process of being actualized as the space through which it travels. The plane is therefore divided into a multiplicity of planes according to the cuts in the continuum, and to the divisions of force which mark the actualization of the virtual. But all the planes merge into one following the path which leads to the actual. The plane of immanence includes both the virtual and its actualization simultaneously, without there being any assignable limit between the two. The actual is the complement or the product, the object of actualization, which has nothing but virtual as its subject. Actualization belongs to the virtual. The actualization of the virtual is singularity whereas the actual itself is individuality constituted. The actual falls from the plane like a fruit, whist the actualization relates it back to the plane as if to that which turns the object back into a subject.

It is not by means of a metaphor that a banking or stock-market transaction, a claim, a coupon, a credit, is able to arouse people who are not necessarily bankers. And what about the effects of money that grows, money that produces more money? There are socioeconomic "complexes" that are also veritable complexes of the unconscious, and that communicate a voluptuous wave from the top to the bottom of their hierarchy (the military-industrial complex). And ideology, Oedipus, and the phallus have nothing to do with this, because they depend on it rather than being its impetus. For it is a matter of flows, of stocks, of breaks in and fluctuations of flows; desire is present wherever something flows and runs, carrying along with it interested subjectsbut also drunken or slumbering subjectstoward lethal destinations.

Something in the world forces us to think. This something is an object not of recognition but of a fundamental encounter. What is encountered may be Socrates, a temple or a demon. It may be grasped in a range of affective tones: wonder, love, hatred, suffering. In whichever tone, its primary characteristic is that it can only be sensed. In this sense it is opposed to recognition.

The rite, the becoming-animal of the scapegoat clearly illustrates this: a first expiatory animal is sacrificed, but a second is driven away, sent out into the desert wilderness. In the signifying regime, the scapegoat represents a new form of increasing entropy in the system of signs: it is charged with everything that was "bad" in a given period, that is, everything that resisted signifying signs, everything that eluded the referral from sign to sign through the different circles; it also assumes everything that was unable to recharge the signifier as its center and carries off everything that spills beyond the outermost circle.

There are, you see, two ways of reading a book: you either see it as a box with something inside and start looking for what it signifies, and then if you're even more perverse or depraved you set off after signifiers. And you treat the next book like a box contained in the first or containing it. And you annotate and interpret and question, and write a book about the book, and so on and on. Or there's the other way: you see the book as a little non-signifying machine, and the only question is "Does it work, and how does it work?" How does it work for you? If it doesn't work, if nothing comes through, you try another book. This second way of reading's intensive: something comes through or it doesn't. There's nothing to explain, nothing to understand, nothing to interpret.

Destiny never consists in step-by-step deterministic relations between presents which succeed one another according to the order of a represented time. Rather, it implies between successive presents non-localisable connections, actions at a distance, systems of replay, resonance and echoes, objective chances, signs, signals, and roles which transcend spatial locations and temporal successions.

The administrations in charge never cease announcing supposedly necessary reforms: to reform schools, to reform industries, hospitals, the armed forces, prisons. But everyone knows that these institutions are finished, whatever the length of their expiration periods. Its only a matter of administering their last rites and of keeping people employed until the installation of the new forces knocking at the door. These are the societies of control, which are in the process of replacing the disciplinary societies. Control is the name Burroughs proposes as a term for the new monster, one that Foucault recognizes as our immediate future.

Cuando alguien pregunta para qu sirve la filosofa, la respuesta debe ser agresiva ya que la pregunta se tiene por irnica y mordaz. La filosofa no sirve ni al Estado ni a la Iglesia, que tienen otras preocupaciones. No sirve a ningn poder establecido. La filosofa sirve para entristecer. Una filosofa que no entristece o no contrara a nadie no es una filosofa. Sirve para detestar la estupidez, hace de la estupidez una cosa vergonzosa. Solo tiene este uso: denunciar la bajeza del pensamiento bajo todas sus formas. Existe alguna disciplina, fuera de la filosofa, que se proponga la crtica de todas las mixtificaciones, sea cual sea su origen y su fin? Denunciar las ficciones sin las que las fuerzas reactivas no podran prevalecer. Denunciar en la mixtificacin esta mezcla de bajeza y estupidez que forma tambin la asombrosa complicidad de las vctimas y de los autores. En fin, hacer del pensamiento algo agresivo, activo y afirmativo. Hacer hombres libres, es decir, hombres que no confundan los fines de la cultura con el provecho del Estado, la moral o la religin. Combatir el resentimiento, la mala conciencia, que ocupan el lugar del pensamiento. Vencer lo negativo y sus falsos prestigios. Quin, a excepcin de la filosofa, se interesa por todo esto? La filosofa como crtica nos dice lo ms positivo de s misma: empresa de desmixtificacin. Y, a este respecto, que nadie se atreva a proclamar el fracaso de la filosofa. Por muy grandes que sean, la estupidez y la bajeza seran an mayores si no subsistiera un poco de filosofa que, en cada poca, les impide ir todo lo lejos que querran, que respectivamente les prohbe, aunque solo sea por el qu dirn, ser todo lo estpida y lo baja que cada una por su cuenta deseara. No les son permitidos ciertos excesos, pero quin, excepto la filosofa, se los prohbe? quin les obliga a enmascararse, a adoptar aires nobles e inteligentes, aires de pensador.

Perhaps this is the supreme act of philosophy: not so much to think THE plane of immanence as to show that it is there, unthought in every plane, and to think it in this way as the outside and inside of thought, as the not-external outside and the not internal inside--that which cannot be thought and yet must be thought, which was thought once, as Christ was incarnated once, in order to show, that one time, the possibility of the impossible.

O dipo no serve estritamente para nada, a no ser para apertar o inconsciente dos dois lados. Veremos em que sentido  que o dipo  estritamente "indecidvel, como dizem os matemticos. Estamos fartos dessas histrias em que se est bem de sade graas ao dipo, doente do dipo, e em que h vrias doenas dentro do dipo. Pode at acontecer que um analista se farte desse mito que  a gamela e a cova da psicanlise e que retorne s origens: Freud nunca chegou a sair nemdo mundo do pai, nem da culpabilidade ... Mas foi o primeiro que, ao criar a possibilidade de construir uma lgica de relao com o pai, abriu o caminho para o homem se libertar do domnio do pai. A possibilidade de viver para!d da lei do pai, para l de qualquer lei, talvez seja a possibilidade mais essencial que a psicanlise freudiana criou. Mas, paradoxalmente, e talvez por causa do prprio Freud, tudo leva a crer que essa libertao que a psicanlise permite se far - se faz j - fora dela,>.Todavia, no podemos partilhar nem deste pessimismo nem deste optimismo. Porque  preciso muito optimismo para pensar que, psicanlise permite uma verdadeira soluo do dipo: o dipo  como Deus; o pai  como Deus; s se resolve o problema quando se suprimir tanto o problema (orno a soluo. A esquizo-anlise no se prope resolver o dipo, no pretende resolv-Io melhor que a psicanlise edipiana. Prope-se desedipianizar o inconsciente para poder chegar aos verdadeiros problemas. Prope-se atingir essas regies do inconsciente rfo (para l de todas as leis, em que o problema deixa de poder ser posto. E por consequncia, tambm no partilhamos do pessimismo de pensar que essa mudana, essa libertao s se pode fazer fora da psicanlise. Pensamos, pelo contrrio, que  possvel dar-se uma reverso interna que.transforme a mquina analtica numa pea indispensvel do aparelho revolucionrio. Mais: j h mesmo condies objectivas para isso.
Tudo se passa, pois, como se o dipo tivesse dois plos: um plo de figuras Imaginrias de identificao e um plo de funes simblicas diferenciantes. Mas seja como for estamos edipianizados: se no temos o dipo como crise, temo-lo como estrutura. Ento transmitimos a crise a OUtrOS, e tudo volta a comear. E  esta a disjuno edipiana, o movimento de pndulo, a razo inversa exclusiva. E  por isso que quando nos convidam a superar uma concepo simplista do dipo fundada em imagens paternas, por uma concepo em que se definem funes simblicas numa estrutura, e se substitui o pap-mam tradicional por uma funo-me e uma funo-pai, no vemos o que  que se ganha com isso, a no ser o fundar a universalidade do dipo para alm da variabilidade das imagens, soldar ainda melhor o desejo  lei e ao interdito, e levar a cabo o processo de edipianizao do inconsciente. Estes so os dois extremos do dipo, o seu mnimo e o seu mximo, consoante o consideremos como tendente para o valor indiferenciado das suas imagens variveis, ou para a capacidade de diferenciao das suas funes simblicas. Quando nos aproximamos da imaginao material, funo diferencial
diminui e tende-se para equivalncias; quando nos aproximamos dos elementos
formadores, a funo diferencial aumenta e tende-se para valncias distintivas . Depois disto, no nos espantava nada ouvir dizer que o dipo como estrutura  a trindade crist, enquanto que o dipo como crise  a trindade familiar, insuficientemente estruturada pela f; sempre os dois plos em razo inversa, dipo for ever.' Quantas interpretaes do lacanismo, oculta ou abertamente piedosas, invocaram um dipo estrutural para formar e fechar o duplo impasse, para nos reconduzirem  questo do pai, para conseguirem edipianizar o esquizo, e mostrar que uma lacuna no simblico nos remete para o imaginrio e que, inversamente, as insuficincias ou confuses imaginrias nos remetem para a estrutura. Como um clebre precursor dizia aos seus animais: chega de lengalenga...

Parnet: I want you to talk about desire. What is desire, exactly? Let's consider the question as simply as possible. When Anti-Oedipus...

Deleuze: It's not what they thought it was, in any case, not what they thought it was, even back then. Even, I mean, the most charming people who were... It was a big ambiguity, it was a big misunderstanding, or rather a little one, a little misunderstanding. I believe that we wanted to say something very simple. In fact, we had an enormous ambition, notably when one writes a book, we thought that we would say something new, specifically that one way or another, people who wrote before us didn't understand what desire meant. That is, in undertaking our task as philosophers, we were hoping to propose a new concept of desire. But, regarding concepts, people who don't do philosophy mustn't think that they are so abstract... On the contrary, they refer to things that are extremely simple, extremely concrete, we'll see this later... There are no philosophical concepts that do not refer to non-philosophical coordinates. It's very simple, very concrete. What we wanted to express was the simplest thing in the world. We wanted to say: up until now, you speak abstractly about desire because you extract an object that's presumed to be the object of your desire. So, one could say, I desire a woman, I desire to leave on a trip, I desire this, that. And we were saying something really very simple, simple, simple: You never desire someone or something, you always desire an aggregate. It's not complicated. Our question was: what is the nature of relations between elements in order for there to be desire, for these elements to become desirable? I mean, I don't desire a woman - I'm ashamed to say things like that since Proust already said it, and it's beautiful in Proust: I don't desire a woman, I also desire a landscape that is enveloped in this woman, a landscape that, if needs be - I don't know - but that I can feel. As long as I haven't yet unfolded the landscape that envelops her, I will not be happy, that is, my desire will not have been attained, my desire will remain unsatisfied. I believe in an aggregate with two terms: woman/landscape, and it's something completely different. If a woman says, "I desire a dress," or "I desire (some) thing" or "(some) blouse," it's obvious that she does not desire this dress or that blouse in the abstract. She desires it in an entire context, a context of her own life that she is going to organize, the desire in relation not only with a landscape, but with people who are her friends, with people who are not her friends, with her profession, etc. I never desire some thing all by itself, I don't desire an aggregate either, I desire from within an aggregate.

was hltst du von den neuen philosophen?

nichts. ich glaube das in ihrem denken nichts drin ist und dafr sehe ich zwei mgliche grnde: ersten hantieren sie mit grossen begriffen (hohle zhne) DAS GESETZ DIE MACHT DER HERR DIE WELT
DIE REBELLION DER GLAUBE und so weiter. sie knnen so komische mischungen herstellen (summarische dualismen) DAS GESETZ UND DER REBELL DIE MACHT UND DER ENGEL. und parallel: je schwcher der
gedankliche inhalt ist, dest mehr bedeutung gesteht sich der denker (das aussagesubjekt) zu in anbetracht der leeren aussagen ("ich, scharfsinnig und mutig, sage ihnen... als soldat christi... als einer der verlorenen generation...wir, die wir mai 68 gemacht haben...wir, die wir uns nicht nochmal tuschen lassen")
Mit diesen beiden Aussagen zerstren sie die arbeit. denn schon seit lngerem versuchen leute von allen mglichen gebieten, diese gefahren zu vermeiden. [...]

es gibt mehrere sehr verschiedene problem, zunchst hat man sich in frankreich lange an die literarischen moden gewisser schulen gehalte. das ist schon das schreckliche, eine schule: es gibt dort
immer einen papst, manifeste, erklrungen vom typ "ich bin die avantgarde", exkommunikationen, tribunal, politische kehrtwendungen etc. im allgemeinen ist man umso mehr im recht, wenn man sein leben
damit zugebracht hat, sich zu tuschen, weil dann kann man immer sagen: "ich bin da durchgegangen" deshalb knnen nur die stalinisten antistalinistische lektionen erteilen.[...]

aus marketing perspektive muss jedes buch oder produkt mehrere versionen haben um jedem zu gefallen, eine fromme version, eine atheistische, eine heideggerianische, eine linke, eine zentristische, vllt sogar eine chiracistische oder neofaschistische, eine nuancierte volksfront version auch. daher die bedeutung der rollenverteilung je nach geschmack:
CLAVEL hat was von dr mabuse eine art evangelischer mabuse JAMBET UND LARDREAU sind seine gehilfen BENOIST ist das streitpferd LEVY ist mal impressario mal scriptgirlmal der frhliche animateur mal
der dj FABRE-LUCE macht sich zum schler glucksmanns JULIEN BENDA wird wieder aufgelegt wegen der tugend des intellektuellen. was fr eine komische zusammenkunft.


es kam zu einer homogenisierung der beiden tendenzen, die gegen die linke gerichtet war aber seit den ersten bchern immer vom selben thema ausging, der hass auf 68. es ging drum wer am besten auf mai 68 spuckte. diesem hass gemss haben sie ihr aussagesubjekt konstituiert: "wir die wir mai 68 gemacht haben knnen euch sagen da das dumm war und dass wir das nicht mehr machen werden" einen
groll auf 68, mehr haben sie nicht zu verkaufen. [...] darber wird alles gebrochen: marxismus maoismus sozialismus etc nicht weil die realen kmpfe neue feinde probleme oder mittel auftauchen lassen sondern weil die revolution fr unmachbar erklrt werden muss, kategorisch und fr immer. deshalb hat man alle begriffe die zuerst sehr differenziert funktionierten (die mchte die widerstnde die wnsche die plebs sogar) aufs neue wiedervereinigt in der langweiligen einheit der macht, des gesetzes, des staates [check ich auch nicht tbh die stelle]. deshalb tritt auch das denkende subjekt wieder auf die bhne , denn die einzige mglichkeit zur revolution ist fr die neuen philosophen der reine akt des denkers, der sie als unmglich denkt.
was mich ankotzt ist sehr einfach: die neuen philosophen machen eine martyrologie, der gulag und die opfer der geschichte. sie leben von kadavern. sie haben die zeugenfunktion entdeckt.

Le problme d'crire : l'crivain, comme dit Proust, invente dans la langue une nouvelle langue, une langue trangre en quelque sorte. Il met  jour de nouvelles puissances grammaticales ou syntaxiques. Il entrane la langue hors de ses sillons coutumiers, il la fait dlirer. Mais aussi le problme d'crire ne se spare pas d'un problme de voir et d'entendre : en effet, quand une autre langue se cre dans la langue, c'est le langage tout entier qui tend vers une limite  asyntaxique ,  agrammaticale , ou qui communique avec son propre dehors.

Spaiile lui Riemann sunt lipsite de orice fel de omogenitate. Fiecare dintre ele se caracterizeaz prin forma expresiei care definete ptratul distanei dintre dou puncte infinit nvecinate. ... Rezult de aici c doi observatori aflai nvecinai pot s repereze ntr-un spaiu riemannian punctele care se afl n imediata lor vecintate, dar nu pot, fr stabilirea unei noi convenii, s se repereze unul fa de cellalt. Fiecare vecintate este deci ca o mic bucat de spaiu euclidian, dar racordarea dintre o vecintate i urmtoarea nu e definit i poate fi fcut ntr-o infinitate de moduri. Spaiul riemannian cel mai general se prezint, astfel, ca o colecie amorf de buci juxtapuse fr a fi legate (Albert Lautmann, Les schmas de structure, Hermann, 1938, pp.23, 34-35); aceast mulime poate fi definit independent de orice referire la o metric, prin condiii de frecven sau, mai curnd, de acumulare valabile pentru un ansamblu de vecinti, condiii total diferite de cele care determin spaiile metrice i tieturile lor (chiar dac un raport ntre cele dou feluri de spaiu trebuie s decurg de aici). Pe scurt, dac urmm frumoasa descriere a lui Lautmann, spaiul riemannian este un pur patchwork. Are conexiuni sau raporturi tactile. Are valori ritmice care nu se regsesc n alt parte, chiar dac pot fi traduse ntr-un spaiu metric. Eterogen, n variaie continu, este un spaiu neted, n msura n care este amorf, nu omogen.

Enclosures are molds, distinct castings, but controls are a modulation, like a self-deforming cast that will continually change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will transmute from point to point.
This is obvious in the matter of salaries: the factory was a body that contained its internal forces at a level of equilibrium, the highest possible in terms of production, the lowest possible in terms of wages; but in a society of control, the corporation has replaced the factory, and the corporation is a spirit, a gas.

Deleuze and Guattari have been totally misunderstood because the following has been wrenched from context: "Forming grammatically correct sentences is for the normal individual the prerequisite for any submission to social laws. No one is supposed to be ignorant of grammaticality; those who are belong in special institutions. The unity of language is fundamentally political." (112)
They are NOT advocating for this sort of prescriptive approach to language; rather, they are describing the social system around language--how language is a political tool. Why persist in quoting them as though they are promoting some sort of linguistic purity?

The death of a social machine has never been heralded by a disharmony or a dysfunction; on the contrary, social machines make a habit of feeding on
the contradictions they give rise to, on the crises they provoke, on the anxieties they engender, and on the infernal operations they regenerate. Capitalism has learned this, and has ceased doubting itself, while even socialists have abandoned belief in the possibility of capitalism's natural death by attrition. No one has ever died from contradictions. And the more it breaks down, the more it schizophrenizes, the better it works, the American way.

It is at work everywhere, functioning smoothly at times, at other times in fits and starts. It breathes, it heats, it eats. It shits and fucks. What a mistake to have ever said the id. Everywhere it is machinesreal ones, not figurative ones: machines driving other ma- chines, machines being driven by other machines, with all the necessary couplings and connections. An organ-machine is plugged into an energy-source-machine: the one produces a flow that the other inter- rupts. The breast is a machine that produces milk, and the mouthi machine coupled to it. The mouth of the anorexic wavers between several functions: its possessor is uncertain as to whether it is an eating-machine, an anal machine, a talking-machine, or a breathing machine (asthma attacks). Hence we are all handymen: each with his little machines. For every organ-machine, an energy-machine: all the time, flows and interruptions. Judge Schreber* has sunbeams in his ass. A solar anus. And rest assured that it works: Judge Schreber feels something, produces something, and is capable of explaining the process theoretically. Something is produced: the effects of a machine, not mere metaphors.

Cuando la nocin de sentido tomo el relevo de las desfallecidas Esencias, la frontera filosfica pareci instalarse entre los que ligaban el sentido con una nueva trascendencia, nuevo avatar de Dios, cielo transformado, y los que encontraban el sentido en el hombre y su abismo, profundidad nuevamente abierta, subterrnea. Nuevos telogos de un cielo brumoso (el cielo de Koenigsberg), y nuevos humanistas de las cavernas, ocuparon la escena en nombre del Dios-hombreo del Hombre-dios como secreto del sentido. A veces era difcil distinguir entre ellos. Pero lo que hace hoy imposible la distincin es, en primer lugar, el cansancio que tenemos de este interminable discurso que sigue preguntndose si es el asno quien carga con el hombre o si es el hombre el que carga al asno y a s mismo. Adems, tenemos la impresin de que hay un contrasentido puro operado sobre el sentido; porque, de cualquier forma, cielo o subterrneo, el sentido se presenta como Principio, Depsito, Reserva, Origen. Principio celeste, se dice de l que est fundamentalmente velado y olvidado; principio subterrneo, que est profundamente tachado, desplazado, alienado. Pero, tanto bajo la tachadura como bajo el velo, se nos invita a reencontrar y restaurar el sentido, sea en un Dios al que no se habra comprendido lo suficiente, sean en un hombre al que no se habra sondeado suficientemente. Es pues agradable que resuene hoy la buena nueva: el sentido no es nunca principio ni origen, es producto. No est por descubrir, ni restaurar ni reemplazar; est por producir con nuevas maquinarias.

The artist is the master of objects; he puts before us shattered, burned, broken-down objects, converting them to the regime of desiring-machines, breaking down is part of the very functioning of desiring-machines; the artist
presents paranoiac machines, miraculating-machines, and celibate machines as so many technical machines, so as to cause desiring-machines to undermine technical machines. Even more important, the work of art is itself a desiring-machine.

We cannot live outside our bodies, our friends, some sort of human cluster, and at the same time, we are bursting out of this situation. The question which poses itself then is one of the conditions which allow the acceptance of the other, the acceptance of a subjective pluralism. It is a matter not only of tolerating another group, another ethnicity, another sex, but also of a desire for dissensus, otherness, difference. Accepting otherness is a question not so much of right as of desire. This acceptance is possible precisely on the condition of assuming the multiplicity within oneself.

Fitzgerald contrasts rupture with structural pseudobreaks in so-called signifying chains. But he also distinguishes it from more supple, more subterranean links or stems of the "voyage" type, or even from molecular conveyances. "The famous 'Escape' or 'run away from it all' is an excursion in a trap even if the trap includes the South Seas, which are only for those who want to paint them or sail them. A clean break is something you cannot come back from; that is irretrievable because it makes the past cease to exist." Can it be that voyages are always a return to rigid segmentarity? Is it always your daddy and mommy that you meet when you travel, even as far away as the South Seas, like Melville? Hardened muscles? Must we say that supple segmentarity itself reconstructs the great figures it claimed to escape, but under the microscope, in miniature? Beckett's unforgettable line is an indictment of all voyages: "We don't travel for the fun of it, as far as I know; we're foolish, but not that foolish.
