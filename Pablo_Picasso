People who try to explain pictures are usually barking up the wrong tree.

It would be very curious to record by means of photographs, not the stage of the picture, but its metamorphoses.

Neither is there figurative and non-figurative art. All things appear to us in the shape of forms. Even in metaphysics ideas are expressed by forms.
